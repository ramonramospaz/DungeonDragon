 Dungeons and Dragons character sheet generator
 
This is a web page that generates a charater sheet in pdf format. it uses js, html5, ccs and the JSPDF library for the generation of the PDF file. I used the Google App Engine as my hosting platform. If you plan to test the page in a local server, you must change the direction of the background image and the button on the ccs.
